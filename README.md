# **FAZE the Movie**

![Mokeup image]()

## **Goal for this project**

FAZE is an upcoming movie, due for release autumn 2021. A contained sci-fi thriller, this movie is high stakes, high tension and high altitude - literally. This top secret mission is under wraps at the moment, but you can follow us to get the latest exclusive news as it comes and of course book your special ticket deals when we announce our theatres later this year. This is one you won't want to miss!

Thank you for visiting my project! If you have any feedback or questions, head over to my GitHub contact details and feel free to reach out to me.
